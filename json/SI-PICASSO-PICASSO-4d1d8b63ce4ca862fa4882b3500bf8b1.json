These results were obtained using a subset of 10 detectors with a total target mass of 0.72 kg of 19F and an exposure of 114 kgd. The low backgrounds in PICASSO allow recoil energy thresholds as low as 1.7 keV to be obtained which results in an increased sensitivity to interactions from Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) with masses below 10 GeV/c2. No dark matter signal was found. Best exclusion limits in the spin dependent sector were obtained for WIMP masses of 20 GeV/c2 with a cross section on protons of σpSD=0.032 pb (90% C.L.). In the spin independent sector close to the low mass region of 7 GeV/c2 favoured by CoGeNT and DAMA/LIBRA, cross sections larger than σpSI=1.41×10−4 pb (90% C.L.) are excluded.}}", "category": "Limit", "shape": "curve", "x-units": "GeV", "y-units": "cm^2", "x": [4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.25, 5.5, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0, 12.0, 14.0, 16.0, 18.0, 20.0, 24.0, 28.0, 32.0, 36.0, 40.0, 44.0, 48.0, 52.0, 56.0, 60.0, 65.0, 70.0, 75.0, 80.0, 85.0, 90.0, 95.0, 100.0, 150.0, 200.0, 300.0, 400.0, 500.0], "y": [7.2423e-40, 4.5331e-40, 3.0684e-40, 2.6443e-40, 2.3327e-40, 1.9002e-40, 1.4119e-40, 1.1478e-40, 9.8122e-41, 8.7262e-41, 7.5731e-41, 6.9555e-41, 6.7136e-41, 6.6004e-41, 6.5644e-41, 6.6646e-41, 6.7874e-41, 7.234e-41, 7.5976e-41, 7.9225e-41, 8.289e-41, 8.7545e-41, 9.1766e-41, 9.6083e-41, 1.0151e-40, 1.0718e-40, 1.127e-40, 1.1879e-40, 1.2486e-40, 1.3016e-40, 1.3689e-40, 1.4246e-40, 1.4782e-40, 2.0985e-40, 2.7141e-40, 3.9531e-40, 5.1809e-40, 6.4321e-40]}
