We present new constraints on dark matter interactions using 1.7 years of COSINE-100 data. The COSINE-100 experiment, consisting of 106 kg of tallium-doped sodium iodide [NaI(Tl)] target material, is aimed to test DAMA\u2019s claim of dark matter observation using the same NaI(Tl) detectors. Improved event selection requirements, a more precise understanding of the detector background, and the use of a larger dataset considerably enhance the COSINE-100 sensitivity for dark matter detection. No signal consistent with the dark matter interaction is identified and rules out model-dependent dark matter interpretations of the DAMA signals in the specific context of standard halo model with the same NaI(Tl) target for various interaction hypotheses. } }", "category": "Limit", "shape": "curve", "x-units": "GeV", "y-units": "pb", "x": [7.92215, 10.2549, 14.4673, 20.4099, 37.2721, 62.4544, 104.651, 269.612, 825.018, 2998.56], "y": [0.00049602, 0.000125268, 1.984e-05, 2.07387e-05, 4.03468e-06, 8.51218e-07, 4.80439e-07, 6.36931e-07, 2.72387e-06, 8.00682e-06]}
