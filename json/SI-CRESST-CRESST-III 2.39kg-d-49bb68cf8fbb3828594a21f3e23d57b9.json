The CRESST target consists of scintillating CaWO4 crystals, which are operated as cryogenic calorimeters at millikelvin temperatures. Each interaction in the CaWO4 target crystal produces a phonon signal and a light signal that is measured by a second cryogenic calorimeter. Since the CRESST-II result in 2015, the experiment is leading the field of direct dark matter search for dark matter masses below 1.7 GeV/c2, extending the reach of direct searches to the sub-GeV/c2 mass region. For CRESST-III, whose Phase 1 started in July 2016, detectors have been optimized to reach the performance required to further probe the low-mass region with unprecedented sensitivity. In this contribution the achievements of the CRESST-III detectors will be dscussed together with preliminary results and perspectives of Phase 1.}}", "category": "Limit", "shape": "curve", "x-units": "GeV", "y-units": "pb", "x": [0.35, 0.3605, 0.371315, 0.382454, 0.393928, 0.405746, 0.417918, 0.430456, 0.44337, 0.456671, 0.470371, 0.484482, 0.499016, 0.513987, 0.529406, 0.545289, 0.561647, 0.578497, 0.595852, 0.613727, 0.632139, 0.651103, 0.670636, 0.690755, 0.711478, 0.732822, 0.754807, 0.777451, 0.800775, 0.824798, 0.849542, 0.875028, 0.901279, 0.928317, 0.956167, 0.984852, 1.0144, 1.04483, 1.07617, 1.10846, 1.14171, 1.17596, 1.21124, 1.24758, 1.28501, 1.32356, 1.36327, 1.40416, 1.44629, 1.48968, 1.53437, 1.5, 1.65, 1.815, 1.9965, 2.19615, 2.41577, 2.65734, 2.92308, 3.21538, 3.53692, 3.89061, 4.27968, 4.70764, 5.17841, 5.69625, 6.26587, 6.89246, 7.58171, 8.33988, 9.17386, 10.0912, 11.1004, 12.2104, 13.4315, 14.7746, 16.2521, 17.8773, 19.665], "y": [47.1941, 17.6798, 8.54909, 4.93628, 3.14585, 1.90839, 1.18953, 0.795958, 0.551857, 0.383654, 0.280062, 0.212892, 0.16609, 0.133098, 0.109415, 0.0914307, 0.0780026, 0.0672703, 0.0584891, 0.0516305, 0.0458676, 0.0410373, 0.0369375, 0.0333242, 0.0303348, 0.0276968, 0.0246659, 0.0220601, 0.0198421, 0.0179292, 0.0163031, 0.0148651, 0.013615, 0.0125231, 0.0115346, 0.0106747, 0.0098949, 0.0092141, 0.00852642, 0.00789589, 0.00733694, 0.00684769, 0.00640988, 0.00599287, 0.00554795, 0.00516593, 0.00484359, 0.00455921, 0.00431755, 0.00405123, 0.00368093, 0.00396389, 0.00282114, 0.00188321, 0.0012229, 0.000806983, 0.000546273, 0.000391452, 0.000293826, 0.00021391, 0.000159481, 0.000118936, 9.05339e-05, 7.01851e-05, 5.46525e-05, 4.0578e-05, 2.98785e-05, 2.28415e-05, 1.69921e-05, 1.23246e-05, 9.25271e-06, 7.15645e-06, 6.02732e-06, 4.96546e-06, 4.548e-06, 4.33295e-06, 4.54086e-06, 3.90659e-06, 3.58628e-06]}
